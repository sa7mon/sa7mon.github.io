At that time my goal was to learn more about Linux, FreeBSD, and virtualization tools as well as having an &amp;ldquo;always-on&amp;rdquo; machine to do long-running tasks. This post is a snapshot of what the network looks like today as well as a little history behind the different parts.

The Docker image that was being used was deleted by the author and so was not usable. I have updated the instructions to work again, though the image it uses now runs Oracle 18c. If you need to run 12c specifically, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to look for instructions elsewhere. Some screenshots may now be out of date.
In this post, we will go through the steps of installing Oracle 12c in a Docker container and connect to the database using SQL Developer on a Mac.</description></item></channel></rss>
