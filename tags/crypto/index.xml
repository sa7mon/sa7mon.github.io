Like most people, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty burnt out with all these new coins and ICO&amp;rsquo;s popping up each week. In fact, I get about 5-10 ICO spam emails in my Junk mail folder.
This one looked to be just a little different, though. He was excited because this one allows you to use your phone to mine. I talked to him about how it&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea, but ultimately probably won&amp;rsquo;t be profitable, especially compare to a multi-GPU setup.</description></item></channel></rss>
