At that time my goal was to learn more about Linux, FreeBSD, and virtualization tools as well as having an &amp;ldquo;always-on&amp;rdquo; machine to do long-running tasks. This post is a snapshot of what the network looks like today as well as a little history behind the different parts.&lt;/p>

This was done in FreeNAS (FreeBSD), but the steps should apply to any *nix system with ZFS&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The great thing about ZFS is that we can do most of this migration with our services and everything still running.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll start by taking a snapshot of the dataset we want to move.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Allow a Chromecast through a WatchGuard firewall</title><link>https://danthesalmon.com/posts/allow-a-chromecast-through-a-watchguard-firewall/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2017 21:44:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://danthesalmon.com/posts/allow-a-chromecast-through-a-watchguard-firewall/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="background">Background&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I recently picked up a Chromecast for my TV so I could stream Netflix easier since &lt;a href="http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=211574">XBMC’s addon&lt;/a> is terrible if you don’t want to use a keyboard. It was super easy to setup, but after it updated and connected to my WiFi I couldn’t see it from my phone. I did some digging and found that my WatchGuard 25W was the culprit. After I added an any-any rule I was able to see it, but that left it wide-open on my network. This wouldn’t do. I did some looking around on the net and found &lt;a href="https://blog.g3rt.nl/allow-google-chromecast-host-firewall-iptables.html">this great write-up&lt;/a> by Gert van Dijk detailing the rules needed when using iptables.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
