 The Issue
 &lt;a href="#the-issue" class="anchor">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Yesterday when trying to transfer an ISO file from a TrueNAS SMB share, I was getting horrible transfer speeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://danthesalmon.com/posts/windows-smb-tailscale/slow1.png"
 alt="Copy progress dialog window showing a speed of 355KB/s">
&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>The NAS can definitely saturate a gigabit link which is what my desktop connects to the switch over. I had seen this behavior before and had a feeling it was related to having Tailscale running - the last time it happened I quit Tailscale and my fast transfers returned.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fix “Some settings are managed by your system administrator” in Windows 7</title><link>https://danthesalmon.com/posts/fix-some-settings-are-managed-by-your-system-administrator-in-windows-7/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2017 21:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://danthesalmon.com/posts/fix-some-settings-are-managed-by-your-system-administrator-in-windows-7/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="background">

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>A few months back, I was doing cleanup on a system that I had cleaned of malware. Whatever junk was on there had configured a local proxy server to run, but Malwarebytes had ripped it out. The system unfortunately still thought it was supposed to use the proxy server that doesn’t exist; consequently, I had no internet access. That’s an easy enough fix, right? I open Internet Options and change the LAN settings to not use a proxy and close it. For some reason, every time I would close the window it would re-configure itself to use the proxy. “Was it still infected?” I wondered. Turns out, in the Advanced tab I get this message:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Change Network Location in Windows 8.1/2012 R2 from Powershell</title><link>https://danthesalmon.com/posts/change-network-location-in-windows-8-1-2012-r2-from-powershell/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2017 20:46:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://danthesalmon.com/posts/change-network-location-in-windows-8-1-2012-r2-from-powershell/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="step-1">
 Step 1
 &lt;a href="#step-1" class="anchor">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>From an elevated PowerShell window issue the following command to gather some information about our current network profile:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="command-line language-powershell" data-output="2-8" data-prompt="C:\>">
&lt;code class="language-powershell">Get-NetConnectionProfile

Name : Unidentified Network
InterfaceAlias : Ethernet
InterfaceIndex : 10
NetworkCategory : Public
IPv4Connectivity : LocalNetwork
IPv6Connectivity : LocalNetwork&lt;/code>
&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The only information we really need from this output is the “InterfaceIndex”&lt;/p>


&lt;h1 id="step-2">
 Step 2
 &lt;a href="#step-2" class="anchor">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>After getting the InterfaceIndex, we run the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="command-line language-powershell" data-output="2-8" data-prompt="C:\>">
&lt;code class="language-powershell">Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceIndex 10 -NetworkCategory Private&lt;/code>
&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The last argument is what category you want to switch it to. The only allowed values here are “Public” or “Private” as per the &lt;a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj899565.aspx">MSDN documentation&lt;/a>. The category can also be “DomainAuthenticated” but Windows will automatically assign this when the machine is added to a domain.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
