The NAS can definitely saturate a gigabit link which is what my desktop connects to the switch over. I had seen this behavior before and had a feeling it was related to having Tailscale running - the last time it happened I quit Tailscale and my fast transfers returned.</description></item><item><title>Fix “Some settings are managed by your system administrator” in Windows 7</title><link>https://danthesalmon.com/fix-some-settings-are-managed-by-your-system-administrator-in-windows-7/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2017 21:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://danthesalmon.com/fix-some-settings-are-managed-by-your-system-administrator-in-windows-7/</guid><description>Background A few months back, I was doing cleanup on a system that I had cleaned of malware. Whatever junk was on there had configured a local proxy server to run, but Malwarebytes had ripped it out.

I open Internet Options and change the LAN settings to not use a proxy and close it.</description></item><item><title>Change Network Location in Windows 8.1/2012 R2 from Powershell</title><link>https://danthesalmon.com/change-network-location-in-windows-8-1-2012-r2-from-powershell/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2017 20:46:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://danthesalmon.com/change-network-location-in-windows-8-1-2012-r2-from-powershell/</guid><description>Step 1 From an elevated PowerShell window issue the following command to gather some information about our current network profile:
Get-NetConnectionProfile Name : Unidentified Network InterfaceAlias : Ethernet InterfaceIndex : 10 NetworkCategory : Public IPv4Connectivity : LocalNetwork IPv6Connectivity : LocalNetwork The only information we really need from this output is the “InterfaceIndex”
Step 2 After getting the InterfaceIndex, we run the following command:
Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceIndex 10 -NetworkCategory Private The last argument is what category you want to switch it to.</description></item></channel></rss>
