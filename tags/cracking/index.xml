&lt;p>The note is not mission critical (gift ideas for my family members), but I would like to have access to it again. I created the note September 21, 2022 and at some point thought it would be funny to put an additional password on a note that contains such trivial information. Some time in the last 6 months, something changed with the note. I used to be able to use TouchID to unlock it, but it began prompting me for a password. Having set it more than a year prior and never having entered it again (to my recollection), I could not remember what it was. I tried all the simple &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; passwords I use when temporarily setting up user accounts, but could not get in.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
