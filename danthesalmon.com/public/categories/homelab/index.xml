      <description>If you run ZFS like I do (and I think you should) there will probably come at time when you need to migrate a dataset from one volume to another. This was done in FreeNAS (FreeBSD), but the steps should apply to any *nix system with ZFS
The great thing about ZFS is that we can do most of this migration with our services and everything still running.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start by taking a snapshot of the dataset we want to move.</description>

      <description>Background I recently picked up a Chromecast for my TV so I could stream Netflix easier since XBMC’s addon is terrible if you don’t want to use a keyboard. It was super easy to setup, but after it updated and connected to my WiFi I couldn’t see it from my phone. I did some digging and found that my WatchGuard 25W was the culprit. After I added an any-any rule I was able to see it, but that left it wide-open on my network.</description>
