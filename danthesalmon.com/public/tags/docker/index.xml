      <description>This is a cautionary tale about something that happened to me in the past few weeks. I&amp;rsquo;m posting it because I believe a lot can be learned by professionals (and others such as me) posting their security fails and problem-solving processes.
I have a server at Hetzner for a personal project. It&amp;rsquo;s running Ubuntu with Docker and there are a few Docker containers running, Postgres and RabbitMQ among them. Last week I logged into the server to do some work and noticed it was running a bit slow.</description>

      <title>Running Oracle 18c on MacOS</title>

      <description>Update: May 14, 2019 This article originally contained instructions for running Oracle 12c. The Docker image that was being used was deleted by the author and so was not usable. I have updated the instructions to work again, though the image it uses now runs Oracle 18c. If you need to run 12c specifically, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to look for instructions elsewhere. Some screenshots may now be out of date.
In this post, we will go through the steps of installing Oracle 12c in a Docker container and connect to the database using SQL Developer on a Mac.</description>
