  <h3 class="h2 post-title">UFW, Docker, and Tailscale: Lessons Learned </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">This is a cautionary tale about something that happened to me in the past few weeks. I&rsquo;m posting it because I believe a lot can be learned by professionals (and others such as me) posting their security fails and problem-solving processes.
I have a server at Hetzner for a personal project. It&rsquo;s running Ubuntu with Docker and there are a few Docker containers running, Postgres and RabbitMQ among them. Last week I logged into the server to do some work and noticed it was running a bit slow.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Tumblr Has a Spam Problem </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I have an account on Tumblr, though I seem to be one of the few people still on the site. Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve noticed an uptick in the amount of spam accounts following me. A considerable increase, in fact, so I decided to try to quantify how pervasive the problem was.
Searching for Spam The first thing I had to do was create some criteria to use for categorizing accounts as &ldquo;spam&rdquo;.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">AttackDefense is a new site with all sorts of awesome labs and CTFs for training. Best of all: the site is free.
In this guide, I&rsquo;ll detail how to complete the &ldquo;Cracking MD5 Hashes&rdquo; lab, though this strategy should work for most labs in the &ldquo;Hashcat All&rdquo; section. If you are unfamiliar with Hashcat, I&rsquo;d strongly recommend reading the wiki or following Youtube tutorials elsewhere before trying this challenge.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Cyber Security Summit 2018 Highlights </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I was fortunate enough to attend the 2018 Cyber Security Summit in Minneapolis, MN. Here I&rsquo;ve tried to summarize each talk I attended into a small, digestible format, mostly written in their voices.
Student Breakfast By: Ryan Aniol - State of Minnesota
This was a super informative informal breakfast hosted by Ryan who aimed the talk at the students like myself. It was really nice to hear information directly relevant to my situation.</p>

Intro Now that the Poison box is retired on hackthebox, we can talk publicly about how to gain access to this machine. While this machine was active, I only took the time to gain user access, not all the way to root.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Running Oracle 18c on MacOS </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Update: May 14, 2019 This article originally contained instructions for running Oracle 12c. The Docker image that was being used was deleted by the author and so was not usable. I have updated the instructions to work again, though the image it uses now runs Oracle 18c. If you need to run 12c specifically, you&rsquo;ll need to look for instructions elsewhere. Some screenshots may now be out of date.
In this post, we will go through the steps of installing Oracle 12c in a Docker container and connect to the database using SQL Developer on a Mac.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Electroneum - First Impressions </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">A coworker recently sent me a link to Yet Another Cryptocurrency. Like most people, I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out with all these new coins and ICO&rsquo;s popping up each week. In fact, I get about 5-10 ICO spam emails in my Junk mail folder.
This one looked to be just a little different, though. He was excited because this one allows you to use your phone to mine. I talked to him about how it&rsquo;s a neat idea, but ultimately probably won&rsquo;t be profitable, especially compare to a multi-GPU setup.</p>
