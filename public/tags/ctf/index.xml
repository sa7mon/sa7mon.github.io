      <description>AttackDefense is a new site with all sorts of awesome labs and CTFs for training. Best of all: the site is free.
In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll detail how to complete the &amp;ldquo;Cracking MD5 Hashes&amp;rdquo; lab, though this strategy should work for most labs in the &amp;ldquo;Hashcat All&amp;rdquo; section. If you are unfamiliar with Hashcat, I&amp;rsquo;d strongly recommend reading the wiki or following Youtube tutorials elsewhere before trying this challenge.</description>

      <description>Note: If you are currently trying to get access to this box, I highly recommend you try it yourself first and only use this guide if you really are stuck. Intro Now that the Poison box is retired on hackthebox, we can talk publicly about how to gain access to this machine. While this machine was active, I only took the time to gain user access, not all the way to root.</description>
