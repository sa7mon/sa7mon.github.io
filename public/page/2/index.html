  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Why I switched from Android to iOS </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Note: This article is not just a stringent comparison of Apple vs Android, but a look at the whole picture that I took while deciding which phone to switch to.
A few months ago, my beloved Verizon HTC One M8 began to lose it’s charge at an alarming rate. It would be at 40% battery by lunch time after a day of very moderate use. Luckily, I was due for an upgrade from Verizon.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Allow a Chromecast through a WatchGuard firewall </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Background I recently picked up a Chromecast for my TV so I could stream Netflix easier since XBMC’s addon is terrible if you don’t want to use a keyboard. It was super easy to setup, but after it updated and connected to my WiFi I couldn’t see it from my phone. I did some digging and found that my WatchGuard 25W was the culprit. After I added an any-any rule I was able to see it, but that left it wide-open on my network.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Fix “Some settings are managed by your system administrator” in Windows 7 </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Background A few months back, I was doing cleanup on a system that I had cleaned of malware. Whatever junk was on there had configured a local proxy server to run, but Malwarebytes had ripped it out. The system unfortunately still thought it was supposed to use the proxy server that doesn’t exist; consequently, I had no internet access. That’s an easy enough fix, right? I open Internet Options and change the LAN settings to not use a proxy and close it.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Change Network Location in Windows 8.1/2012 R2 from Powershell </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Step 1 From an elevated PowerShell window issue the following command to gather some information about our current network profile:
Get-NetConnectionProfile Name : Unidentified Network InterfaceAlias : Ethernet InterfaceIndex : 10 NetworkCategory : Public IPv4Connectivity : LocalNetwork IPv6Connectivity : LocalNetwork The only information we really need from this output is the “InterfaceIndex”
Step 2 After getting the InterfaceIndex, we run the following command:
Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceIndex 10 -NetworkCategory Private The last argument is what category you want to switch it to.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Fix HAXM Emulation Error in Android Studio </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Requirement Note: Android Studio requires an Intel processor with VT-X support for it’s built-in emulators to work. If you want to do Android development with emulators on an AMD processor, I would highly suggest using Genymotion. If you’re not sure if your Intel processor supports VT-X, Intel has an article here.
This error is occurring because Android Studio requires Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (Intel HAXM) to run it’s emulators. All we need to do is install this tool.</p>

An error occurred while installing rake (10.4.2), and Bundler cannot continue. So after doing some research, it turns out all you need to do is a Gem update:
gem update --system Unless of course, this results in this error like it did for me:

  <p class="post-summary">Background I recently forgot my password for SickRage and was surprised by the little documentation online. I have it installed in a jail in FreeNAS, so that’s what I’ll be focused on here but the instructions should be exactly the same if you have it installed inside an OS.
Steps It’s actually really easy, assuming you have command-line access. In FreeNAS, open a shell on your SickRage jail and edit the following file:</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Intro / Credits After much work and starting from scratch a few times, I finally got a working jail put together that uses ruTorrent, rTorrent, and Lighttpd to create a very nice personal seedbox in FreeNAS. I should give a lot of credit to FlyingPersian and his thread on the FreeNAS forum for the great information. I’m going to shamelessly steal a lot of his guide but correct some things and add improvements that I found.</p>
