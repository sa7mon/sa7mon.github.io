      <article class="post-content">
      <p>A coworker recently sent me a link to Yet Another Cryptocurrency. Like most people, I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out with all these new coins and ICO&rsquo;s popping up each week. In fact, I get about 5-10 ICO spam emails in my Junk mail folder.</p>
<p>This one looked to be just a little different, though. He was excited because this one allows you to use your phone to mine. I talked to him about how it&rsquo;s a neat idea, but ultimately probably won&rsquo;t be profitable, especially compare to a multi-GPU setup.</p>
<p>Still, the idea of mobile mining was intriguing. Especially if you could negate the cost of power, since it would be 100% profit at that point.</p>
<p>So I started digging into this coin and here are my initial findings.</p>
<h2 id="site">Site</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was download the app on an old Nexus 6P(?) I had in my parts box. Upon launch it prompts you to login to your Electroneum account. What? I can&rsquo;t just give it a wallet address?</p>
<p>After looking at the website the answer is no: you have to create an online wallet on the my.electroneum.com website and login to the app with that. This sketched me out a bit since web wallets are inherintly less secure than an offline wallet.</p>
<p>I proceeded to the sign up page where I was greeted with some highly suspicous behavior&hellip;.</p>
<p><img src="../images/electroneum-hi.png" alt="electroneum-hi"></p>
<p>When you click the &ldquo;Sign Up&rdquo; button, a Javascript alert box pops up. The only explanations I can come with are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Someone found a XSS vuln and left this here as a proof-of-concept</li>
<li>A dev pushed straight to production</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way this doesn&rsquo;t exactly inspire confidence.</p>
<p><img src="../images/electroneum-alert.png" alt="electroneum-alert">
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180106002628/https://my.electroneum.com/">Archive.org snapshot of the page</a></p>
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/bltjetpack/status/949436050539204609">tweeted at them</a> asking if it was intentional. As of writing, I haven&rsquo;t received a response but a day after I tweeted them the code was gone.</p>
<p>Other than that, the signup process is pretty standard save for the fact that they have a Captcha on <strong>every. single. page.</strong></p>
<h2 id="wallet">Wallet</h2>
<p>Like any coin I assumed I needed to create a wallet to hold my coins so I downloaded the &ldquo;Offline Wallet Generator&rdquo; which is curiously labeled as being compatible with only Chrome.</p>
<!--(Pic of download area)-->
<p>After unzipping the download, I found an HTML file. Wtf? Turns out the &ldquo;Offline Wallet Generator&rdquo; is just Javascript.</p>
<p><img src="../images/electroneum-generate-wallet.png" alt="electroneum-generate-wallet"></p>
<p>The rest of the process is to simply generate some entropy to create the wallet. At the end of the process you get a PDF file as a paper wallet.</p>
<p><img src="../images/electroneum-wallet-pdf.png" alt="electroneum-wallet-pdf"></p>
<p>Truly the strangest wallet-generation process I&rsquo;ve gone through.</p>
<h2 id="mining">Mining</h2>
<p>After finally completing the signup process, I logged into the app only to be greeted with this message:</p>
<p><img src="../images/electroneum-mining-offline.png" alt="electroneum-mining-offline"></p>
<p>There was a Google Form to signup for the mining beta that was open until January 12th.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/electroneum/status/948663752290914304">https://twitter.com/electroneum/status/948663752290914304</a></p>
<p>I signed up and am waiting to hear back on it.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to mine on a mobile device which was a bummer, so I grabbed an old netbook I had. After about 2 hours of searching and trying in vain, it seems there does not exist a CPU miner for Electroneum (or Monero for that matter) that works with the Intel Atom x86 platform running Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I plan to post a follow-up if and when I&rsquo;m finally able to get mining working on my Android phones.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong>
There&rsquo;s also an easter egg on the site. If you look in the <em>robots.txt</em> file you&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s an <a href="https://electroneum.com/adminarea/">/adminarea/</a> directory. If you go there and view the source, you&rsquo;ll find a form that submits to a <em>dontdoit.php</em>. If you then visit this page, it just outputs your public IP address. Not sure what this is for, but may be worth poking around at.</p>
