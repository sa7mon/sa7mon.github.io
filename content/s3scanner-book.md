A coworker told me this week that he was reading [*Metasploit, 2nd Edition*](https://nostarch.com/metasploit-2nd-edition) and saw that it included a recommendation to use [S3Scanner](https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner) for scanning S3 buckets. He and I were both pleasantly surprised to find a reference to my humble project in a real InfoSec book.

I would include a screenshot here, but I don't want to be arrested by the copyright police.

I never thought something I made would end up in a book, but here we are. Life is cool.
