I will be giving a talk with my coworker at SecretCon 2025 in St. Paul, Minnesota on Friday, June 20th. The title of our talk is _Prioritizing Internal Pentests: so much to hack, so little time_

In the talk, we will describe the difficulties of being on an AppSec team that receives more pentest requests than we could ever complete, the challenge of determining what is most important, and how you can do the same if you team is struggling to keep up with a never-ending queue.

If I get approval to share the slides, I will add a link here as well as any videos that get created after the conference concludes.
