## Future

- Rack Proxmox somehow
	- HP rails kit
	- Re-home guts into 3-4U case
	- Finally move to a 2U pre-built server and transfer storage
- Rack FreeNAS box
	- Hard to find small-ish disk shelves. Noise/power are a concern
- Move printer to quarantine VLAN that only CUPS can access
- Rack-mounted KVM for direct access
