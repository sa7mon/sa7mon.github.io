This machine runs everything I need it to without complaint and has done so for years. Recently I started thinking more about replacing it, or at least transplanting its components into something I can rackmount. I don&rsquo;t like that it&rsquo;s the only piece of homelab gear that doesn&rsquo;t reside neatly in the 18U rack.</p><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/rack-before.jpg alt="18U StarTech rack with a switch, router, 2 patch panels, and a shelf installed. Next to the rack on the right side is a free-standing HP workstation." width=600px></figure><p>I would like to move to something rackmount-able because:</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;ve never liked some of the the proprietary HP internals - non-standard PSU, drive trays that I never used (instead, I just let drives hang freely)</li><li>Rackmounted gear is cooler than free-standing desktops</li><li>All the gear is neatly organized in the rack</li><li>Did I mention it&rsquo;s cooler</li></ul><p>Initially I looked for methods by which I could rackmount the Z620. HP does make a rails kit (HP part B8S55AA) that mounts on the top and bottom of the chassis which allows you to rack the desktop sideways, but it takes up 4U of space and kits on the secondary market were ~$150.</p><p>As luck would have it, a kind nerd at work posted that he was giving away a Ryzen 5 1600 and cooler. I acquired the CPU and made up my mind that I would build a new machine around it to replace the Z620.</p><h1 id=part-picking>Part Picking
<a href=#part-picking class=anchor>#</a></h1><p>My goals for the build were</p><ul><li>cheap</li><li>re-use as many components as possible</li><li>TDP &lt;= current levels</li><li>relatively quiet</li><li>most important: rack-mounted</li></ul><p>The parts I knew I wanted to re-use were</p><ul><li>5x SSDs - 4 for the ZFS pool, 1 for the OS</li><li>Mellanox ConnectX-4 10GbE network card for directly connecting to the TrueNAS storage server</li><li>Intel Arc A380 GPU for Jellyfin transcoding</li><li>LSI 9200-8I HBA (if needed) to connect all the SATA drives</li><li>AMD Ryzen 5 1600</li></ul><h2 id=chassis>Chassis
<a href=#chassis class=anchor>#</a></h2><p>The first thing to decide was the size in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_unit>rack units</a> (RU) of the chassis. 4U would certainly fit everything, but I figured I could get away with something much smaller - I am starting to run out of space in this 18U rack after all. 2U looked to be tall enough to accommodate all the components except the GPU which is a full-height PCIe card.</p><p>I looked around online, heavily relying on /r/homelab recommendations for chassis options. The 2 that looked the most promising were:</p><p>Rosewill <a href="https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-z2600u-black/p/9SIA072GJ92852?seoLink=server-components&amp;seoName=Server%20Chassis">RSV-Z2600U</a> has space for 4 3.5" HDDs which I knew would be more than enough room to fit 5 SSDs if I used at least 1 dual SSD mounting bracket (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Dual-Mounting-Bracket-CSSD-BRKT2/dp/B016498CK0?th=1">this</a>).</p><p>Plinkusa <a href=https://www.plinkusa.net/web2026s.htm>IPC-2026-BK</a> which advertises space for 6x 3.5" drives and, crucially, an apparently patented bracket for mounting full-height PCIe cards horizontally (parallel to the motherboard).</p><p>Both were around the $100 range, but I ultimately decided on the Plinkusa chassis both because of the PCIe adapter and because it supports a full ATX motherboard while the Rosewill only supports Micro-ATX.</p><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/plinkusa.jpg alt="low-resolution photos of a 2U chassis with the lid off. The rear shows 11 half-height PCIe slots." width=800px><figcaption><p>Yes, these are the best quality photos they have on the <a href=https://www.plinkusa.net/web2026s.htm>product page</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>As luck would have it, someone was selling the exact model I was looking for on Craigslist for $70 and it came with an Inland non-modular PSU. This was incredibly fortunate since it saved me the $55(!) shipping fee a brand new unit would have included.</p><p>After getting the chassis home, I realized that whatever adapter thing this case normally comes with for full-height PCIe mounting, mine didn&rsquo;t come with it. I emailed the manufacturer asking how I could buy just this adapter for my specific chassis. It took a few days of back and forth, mostly just identifying which chassis I had - it seemed like this company has sold many iterations. Finally, I was quoted a price of $30 (including shipping) for a &ldquo;3 slot riser card window with full set accessory box&rdquo;.</p><p>The price seemed reasonable, but</p><ul><li>they asked me to &ldquo;send $30 to our paypal account <a href=mailto:sales@plinkusa.net>sales@plinkusa.net</a>&rdquo; which felt a bit scammy</li><li>in the time it had taken to arrive at this price, I had already designed and 3D-printed a prototype that was 85% complete and cost pennies to print</li></ul><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/bracket.png alt="Line drawing of a PCI bracket that allows for sideways installation of a full height card into multiple half-height slots" width=600px><figcaption><p>It&rsquo;s certainly not the prettiest part in the world, but it should work</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/pci-bracket-installed.jpg alt="Photo of the printed part installed in the read of the chassis" width=600px></figure><p>The idea is to turn 6 half-height vertical slots into 3 full-height horizontal slots.</p><p>Since the PCI Express standard is well defined and documented, the design process was a breeze once I understood how I needed to orient things. If this print eventually fails or I decide to upgrade later I&rsquo;ll order the official part, but for now this should be fine.</p><h2 id=motherboard>Motherboard
<a href=#motherboard class=anchor>#</a></h2><p>I shopped around for a cheap AM4 motherboard that had 5+ SATA 6Gbs ports and once again lucked out on Craigslist: a used Gigabyte B450 AORUS Pro for $75.</p><p>I started doing some test fits, laying which components would go where when I realized that I might not have enough PCI lanes available with this motherboard if I use the LSI HBA. I summarized the situation in <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1ilrcbo/does_my_proxmox_build_have_enough_pcie_lanes/>a post</a> on /r/homelab.</p><p>After some very helpful replies and thinking better of some harebrained ideas, I arrived at a solution that would ensure enough PCI lanes were available:</p><ol><li>Delete the HBA - connect the drives directly to the onboard SATA ports using some <a href=https://www.ebay.com/itm/126307406194>low-profile 180-degree adapters</a></li><li>Move the SSDs to the very front of the chassis, designing and printing some kind of bracket to hold them all</li><li>Plug the Mellanox 10GbE card into the second PCIe slot</li><li>Run a riser cable over the Mellanox card to connect the GPU to the top PCIe 3.0 x16 slot</li></ol><h2 id=ssds>SSDs
<a href=#ssds class=anchor>#</a></h2><p>For my next part created from scratch, I designed and 3D printed an SSD caddy that would:</p><ul><li>slot into the existing 3.5" drive cage</li><li>securely hold at least 5x 2.5" SATA SSDs on edge</li><li>have adequate space between the drives for airflow</li><li>allow for removal of the drives individually without removing the whole caddy. Once everything is installed, I don&rsquo;t want to have to unplug all the cables and remove the whole caddy just to replace a single drive.</li></ul><p>Again, because the 2.5" drive follows a well-defined spec (<em>SFF-8201: 2.5 Form Factor Drive Dimensions</em>), the design process went very smoothly once I came up with a general design that would allow for single drive removal. 2 re-prints and a few tweaks in OnShape later, I had a part that fit all my criteria.</p><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/ssd-caddy.jpg alt="A white 3D printed part. The left and right sides are triangles while the top and bottom are rectangles. 5 slots are visible on the inside bottom of the part. On the top are 5 countersunk holes for securing the SSDs in place with a screw." width=600px></figure><p>I can&rsquo;t recommend enough a proper set of calipers for designing parts from scratch.</p><p>I ordered a set of thin SATA cables that would allow for a pretty tight bend radius to connect the drives at the front of the chassis.</p><p><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/ssd-caddy-installed.jpg alt="Test fitting with a single SSD was a success.

<a href=#booting class=anchor>#</a></h2><p>It was time to actually try booting the machine! I installed the RAM and CPU sans cooler, plugged it in, and hit the power button.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>No POST, not even any fanspin. I dug out my trusty RadioShack multimeter and tested the PSU cables. All of the 5V and 12V rails seemed fine and I tried plugging in a known-good PSU to no avail. The problem was likely either a dead CPU or dead motherboard.</p><p>I ordered a &ldquo;certified refurbished&rdquo; MSI B450 Gaming Plus Max from eBay; with coupon it came to $88 which seemed fine considering it came with a 2-year warranty. After installing the new board, I crossed my fingers and hit the button. It booted up just fine!</p><h2 id=cooling>Cooling
<a href=#cooling class=anchor>#</a></h2><p>Now it was time to move on to cooling. The AMD Wraith cooler that had come with the Ryzen 5 was too tall for this 2U chassis so I needed to find something lower profile.</p><p>I compared a few Dynatron coolers including the <a href=https://www.dynatron.co/product-page/a47>A47</a> and <a href=https://www.dynatron.co/product-page/a43>A43</a> but ultimately decided against them because of noise levels.</p><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/dynatron.jpg alt="Picture of a CPU cooler whose fan is mounted on the side of the heatsink instead of the top" height=400px><figcaption><p>A side-mounted fan cooler blowing air back instead of up makes more sense in a server chassis, but 59.8 dBA at 100% duty cycle is too loud</p></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, I picked up a Noctua NH-L9A-AM4 from Micro Center (which, if I&rsquo;m honest, was also a major selling point). After mounting it with the included thermal paste, I booted the machine up and explored the BIOS settings. There were constant alerts about the CPU temp, but something about the data seemed fishy.</p><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/bios-temp.jpg alt="Screenshot of the BIOS. The CPU temperature reading is 127C" width=750px><figcaption><p>Something tells me the CPU isn&rsquo;t actually hot enough to boil water</p></figcaption></figure><p>I checked for a BIOS update and sure enough the version after the one installed contained a relevant release note</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span class=line><span class=cl>  -  Fixed incorrect display of CPU temperature and fan speed
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A quick update via USB drive and the temps were now sane.</p><p>The 4x 80mm YATE LOON D80SM-12 fans were pretty scratchy sounding even with the chassis lid closed. To remedy this, I ordered 4 used Sunon Maglev fans from eBay, but didn&rsquo;t realize they would come with Dell proprietary 5-pin fan connectors. I tried to re-pin them to work with the 4-pin PWM fan headers on the motherboard, but ended up returning them and getting 4 Noctua NF-A8 fans which worked perfectly.</p><h1 id=transplanting>Transplanting
<a href=#transplanting class=anchor>#</a></h1><p>At this point I was ready to do the hardware transplant. I had setup another machine with Proxmox and migrated the critical services (mostly Pihole) and could now afford downtime. So on a Saturday night, I shut down the HP workstation and got the SSDs, 10GbE card, and GPU moved over to their new home.</p><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/assembled-1.jpg alt="Internal components of the server shown" width=750px></figure><p>After plugging in the riser cable for the GPU, I realized how comically long it was for this application. Thankfully it was flexible enough that I could still get the chassis lid closed without squishing the cable too hard.</p><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/assembled-2.jpg alt="Side view of the server with the lid open. The riser cable protrudes noticeably up" width=750px></figure><p>At this point, I realized that I couldn&rsquo;t plug any video cables into the rear of the GPU: there was not enough clearance at the top of the bracket.</p><p>Back to OnShape I went to quickly delete the 3rd PCIe slot (I only needed the top 2 anyway) and move the others down. I re-printed the bracket and got it re-installed. Much better.</p><p>Next, I installed the rails. The included instructions were really lacking, but thankfully <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20250117083018/https://forums.serverbuilds.net/t/rack-mounting-the-rosewill-rsv-l4500/2804>this serverbuilds.net post</a> did a great job showing which holes to use on the rack bracket. After unscrewing and re-mounting the rails a total of 3 times, everything fit correctly and I no longer had gaps above the server!</p><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/racked.jpg alt="Front view of the server rack showing the same network components as before, but now with an additional 2U server at the bottom." width=750px><figcaption><p>The shelf below the new server is one of the next projects to tackle</p></figcaption></figure><h1 id=turning-the-key>Turning the Key
<a href=#turning-the-key class=anchor>#</a></h1><p>With the server racked, I booted the machine with all the new components for the first time. I was unceremoniously greeted with an error message from GRUB:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-mysql data-lang=mysql><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w>    </span><span class=n>error</span><span class=p>:</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>symbol</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>`</span><span class=n>grub_is_lockdown</span><span class=o>`</span><span class=w> </span><span class=k>not</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>found</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>Entering</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>rescue</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>mode</span><span class=w>

I tried changing some of the boot options in the motherboard, toggling UEFI / CSM / Secure Boot support, to no avail.</p><p>I decided the quickest way to get past this was a fresh Proxmox re-installation. I knew all my VMs and containers were safe on the ZFS pool and backed up to the TrueNAS server, so I would only need to re-setup a few things. I wiped the boot drive and installed the latest Proxmox from USB drive. One benefit to doing this was that I opted for setting up the boot drive as a single-drive ZFS pool - the previous installation had used the default ext4. This was I can easily snapshot and backup the Proxmox host in addition to the VMs and containers. Nice!</p><h1 id=rebuilding>Rebuilding
<a href=#rebuilding class=anchor>#</a></h1><p>Now that the system booted, I started the work of setting everything back up. I created a bridge with the 10GbE card, set a static IP, and enabled Jumbo Frames by increasing the MTU. The NIC on the other side of the Direct Attach Cable (DAC) in the TrueNAS box had previously been configured for Jumbo Frames. I verified I could ping in both directions successfully and fired off an <code>iperf3</code> test to verify the throughput</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span class=line><span class=cl>root@proxmox:~# iperf3 -c 10.50.1.2 -p <span class=m>3345</span>

This is where all the backups from the older server live - from here I can restore each VM and container one by one.</p><p>With my 4-disk ZFS pool added as a storage backend, I restored my main Docker VM. After it had finished, I was a bit confused by what happened. The restore process had created a Zvol when I had used qcow disk images before. After doing some searching around the proxmox forums, I learned that if your storage type is ZFS, VM disks are stored as ZVOLs. If you want to use qcow or raw files instead, you have to configure the storage type as <code>directory</code>. The proxmox <a href=https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#_storage_types>manual</a> shows a feature comparison of the two and I opted to keep the ZFS storage type set after watching a few <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHkYOD-3fZbuGhwsADBd9ZQ>Tom Lawrence</a> videos on what ZVOLs are and how they work.</p><p>Next I restored the Jellyfin VM and easily setup the PCI passthrough.

After disabling this setting, the server finally survived a full 24 hours!</p><figure><img src=/posts/new-proxmox-server/bios-cstates.jpg alt="Screenshot of the MSI BIOS showing a menu item named 'Global C-state Control' is disabled." width=750px><figcaption><p>A week and a half of troubleshooting later, one toggle was all it took</p></figcaption></figure><h1 id=wrapping-up>Wrapping Up
