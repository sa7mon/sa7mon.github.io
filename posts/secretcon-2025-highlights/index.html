This was my first time attending after having heard about it for the first time a few months ago - I gather this is the 3rd year it has been held. Here are some highlights, in no particular order, from my day and a half there!</p><p><strong>Badge</strong></p><p>The badge did not disappoint - after turning it on, you can use the two buttons on the left and right of the screen used to cycle through the 20ish built-in animations. A few of them reveal the fact that there is a gyroscope on the board as they move when you tilt the badge.</p><figure><img src=/posts/secretcon-2025-highlights/badge.png alt="Picture of an owl-shaped blue PCB with a screen near the mouth area." height=600px></figure><p>I later learned that one of the challenges of the CTF (that I didn&rsquo;t know was happening) was to open a serial console via the USB-C port, discover a text-based adventure game, and ascend to a certain level.</p><p><strong>Hardware Hacking Village</strong></p><p>At the hardware hacking village, a representative from GhostScale was running a soldering workshop. You would receive an ESP32, breakout board, and SD card reader which you could solder together. Then, you could flash the board with <a href=https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder>ESP32Marauder</a> which can do Wifi and Bluetooth attacks. I definitely need to play with this board more as it also has space for additional modules to be added.</p><p><figure><img src=/posts/secretcon-2025-highlights/soldering-station.png alt="4 people are seated at a long table, all concentrating on soldering." height=600px></figure><figure><img src=/posts/secretcon-2025-highlights/esp32.png alt="Close-up of PCB with ESP32 soldered to it." height=600px></figure></p><p><strong>Aerospace Village</strong></p><p>I didn&rsquo;t grab a picture of it, but at this village there was a model airplane connected to a laptop which was running some sort of simulator. I believe the goal of the station was to issue commands to the onboard computer to see if you could override the safety controls.
I ended up talking to the representative Lillian for a good while about everything GNSS, GPS, ADB, and airplane electronics systems design. It was truly fascinating.</p><p><strong>Tin Foil Hat Competition</strong></p><p>I spent a solid hour here. They had a mannequin head set up on the table with a HackRF antenna embedded inside. The goal of the contest was to design a hat made from aluminum foil that would block out the most signals. More signals blocked = more points. After struggling with this for a while and using maybe 10 feet of foil, I managed to hit #2 on the scoreboard. After that, no matter what I added to the hat my score never improved. I walked away after a team walked up with a hat shaped not unlike a dunce cap and grabbed first place. I learned that I do not understand how radio waves work and the fact that my cell phone works at all is plain magic.</p><p><figure><img src=/posts/secretcon-2025-highlights/tinfoil1.png alt="A mannequin head with a tin foil hat covering the top of the head and ears down to the neck" height=600px></figure><figure><img src=/posts/secretcon-2025-highlights/tinfoil2.png alt="A tv screen lists the rankings for classic hats or hybrid hats and each contestants attenuation (dB)" height=600px><figcaption><p>Classic hats only used tin foil, &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; could use a mix of materials.</p></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Lockpicking Village</strong></p><p>This was a fun table to hang out at for a while. I enjoy picking locks, but I am not good at it - this became evident when I was only able to pick my way through 2 of the 6 challenge locks. I would have loved to have learned more about tubular locks, but none were available.</p><figure><img src=/posts/secretcon-2025-highlights/lockpick.png alt="Close up on a table covered in lock picks, tension wrenches, and in the foreground a yellow plastic rectangle with 6 circular lock faces embedded." height=600px></figure><p><strong>Talks</strong></p><p>The talks I attended were great - especially the Friday keynote with Gabe. I have been subscribed to his channel <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@saveitforparts>saveitforparts</a> for quite a while so it was cool seeing his talk <em>Intercepting Satellite Data with Trash</em> in person. It really got me excited to explore the world of SDR more which coincidentally is how I found his channel in the first place.</p><p>The <em>Securing the Skies: Safety and Security in
Aviation and Why It Matters</em> talk by Lillian from the Aerospace Village was also fascinating. I learned a ton about the safety certifications of equipment that goes into planes and how <em>security</em> testing plays a major role in <em>safety</em> testing.</p><p>The closing keynote was a super fun story that there just wasn&rsquo;t enough time to explore deeply: <em>Closing Keynote: We Infiltrated a North Korean Laptop Farm, Here&rsquo;s How We Did It</em>. DPRK remote worker schemes are endlessly fascinating to me and just this week, the DOJ <a href=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-disrupts-north-korean-it-worker-laptop-farm-scheme-in-16-states/>announced</a> the takedown of a major network of laptop farms in the US. I look forward to seeing if he gives this talk at another conference so I can hear the full story.</p><br><br>Overall I had a great time and I hope I can scrape together a talk to give next year!</main></body></html>
