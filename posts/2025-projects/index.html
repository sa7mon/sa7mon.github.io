In general, I&rsquo;m going to try to write more about all the projects I take on whether or not they pan out.</p><p>To help with this and to give myself some pressure to follow through here is a short list of projects I&rsquo;ve either planned, started work on, or am still formulating the idea for.</p><h3 id=s3scanner-documentation>S3Scanner Documentation</h3><p><a href=https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner>S3Scanner</a> now has almost all the features I have planned to add to it. There are a handful of bugs to squash and new providers to add, but the big change I want to make is to <a href=https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner/issues/264>overhaul</a> the documentation.</p><p>The README is too long and there are a lot of implementation differences between the S3 providers that I have noticed that should be documented somewhere. The format will likely be markdown, maybe with a generate like <a href=https://docusaurus.io/>Docusaurus</a> or <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/>MkDocs</a>. The documentation should live &ldquo;next to&rdquo; the source code.</p><h3 id=radio-k-bot>Radio K Bot</h3><p><a href=https://radiok.org/>Radio K</a> is a college radio station broadcasting from the University of Minnesota. I have discovered a ton of great music from the station, but tuning an FM radio to it presents a few issues:</p><ul><li>the radio tower does not use broadcast very far - I cannot receive it in my home office with a cheap FM antenna</li><li>as with all terrestrial radio, there are ads that I would like to skip</li></ul><p>To remedy this, I envision a simple Go app to parse the <a href=https://radiok.org/playlist>playlist</a> once per day and update an Apple Music playlist.</p><h3 id=pager-sniffing-with-hackrf>Pager Sniffing with HackRF</h3><p>The HackRF (and cheaper RTL-SDR dongles) can tune to certain frequencies used by pagers. Amazingly, this tech is still used today and most messages are broadcast large distances without any encryption. I&rsquo;ve managed to receive and decode messages in the past with a different combination of hardware and location, but I&rsquo;d like to document the process for myself and see if I can setup a longer-term collection system to analyze messages.</p><h3 id=38c3-favorite-talks>38C3 Favorite Talks</h3><p>The Chaos Communication Congress is one of my favorite information security conferences every year. I have a list of talks that sound really interesting and I will create a list of my favorites after having watched them.</p><h3 id=running-tor-relays-and-bridges>Running Tor Relays (and bridges)</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve been running a handful of Tor relays and bridges for the past few months. I&rsquo;d like to document my experience setting these up and maintaining them, as well as my impressions of the Tor community.</p><h3 id=off-site-truenas-backup>Off-site TrueNAS Backup</h3><p>As documented in my homelab <a href=/state-of-homelab-2023/>post</a>, I have a TrueNAS system that houses a lot of data. Most of it is not important, but some of it I would like to backup. I plan to document how I built a small form factor DIY NAS to use for off-site backups and the setup process for getting the remote machines to &ldquo;see&rdquo; each other without opening any firewall ports.</p><h3 id=desktop-linux-migration>Desktop Linux Migration</h3><p>The only machine in my house running Windows is my desktop and I would like to change that for a myriad of reasons. I&rsquo;ll document my requirements, Linux distro selection, and results.</p><h3 id=open-source-burp-alternative>Open Source Burp Alternative</h3><p>This is likely a longer-term project than what I could do in a few months, but I&rsquo;m beginning to play around with some Go libraries that should make it easy to build desktop apps. I have little to no experience with desktop apps as most of my development is either with web APIs or command-line tools. To help with my learning experience, I will build an app for pentesters to use when testing web apps. It will combine features of Burp, Caido, and include some useful features I have not seen other tools implement.</p><br><br><br>Time to go do</main></body></html>
